                <p>Though most of my pieces for the final design came together, the final product is definitely rough around the edges.</p>
                <p>I would have preferred to use a 3D printed model for the dancer figure, but I could not make any models I found of the character work.<br>
                They were extracted from a game and designed for rigging, not 3D printing.</p>
                <p>Also, the wiring, though not visible from the front with the lid closed, does stand out a lot.<br>
                I would like to revise this design in such a way that the wires are entirely hidden and the metal plates are much smaller.</p>
                <p>The amount of wood glue I used seems excessive and detracts from the finished look.<br>
                It also managed to glue down some metal shavings from cutting the nails and screws.</p>
                <p>That would have been a less problematic issue if the caddies I had designed for the compartments had worked out.</p>

                <p>I was rather satisfied with the designs, but my sizing was a bit off and I did not manage to get them reprinted in the proper size.<br>
                Without these, the inside feels rather empty (though admittedly, it is just an empty box at the moment).<br>
                Scaling it to be smaller may also help with this problem.</p>
                <p>I also like the hinges and latch, but attaching them to 1/8" wood with too-long nails and screws resulted in them being able to shift.<br>
                In retrospect, I should have used 1/4".</p>
                <p>Some external design, like a vinyl cut wrap or just paint, would definitely contribute to the final look.</p>
                <p>The most significant problem, however, is the fact that the motor does not have enough force to overcome its static friction.<br>
                With no resistors, it spun unimpeded, but the dancer was just a blur. The 100 ohm resistor gives a nice speed, but it must be nudged to start.<br>
                My preferred speed would be much slower, but this motor really cannot go any slower without just stopping.</p>
                <p>Also, the batteries cannot be replaced without yanking out the block and breaking the wiring in the back.<br>
                This should not be an issue, because I will probably revisit and overhaul this design before they die.</p>
